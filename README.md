(Note:- <b>Reason for again updating files in github repository</b>
We submitted the final project files in github repository on November 19 itself, but we unknowingly added the SendGrid mail integration API Key in the GitHub repository. So, SendGrid told us to delete the API Key. After deleting the API Key it shows the error in our project while executing. So, again we have created a new API Key and deployed the project and now we are adding only the updated files and now the new web app works and executed properly without any error.)


<h3>Plasma Donor Application</h3>

<h4>Because of a lack of awareness about plasma donation, there is a high demand for plasma donors, making it difficult for affected patients to find donors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a greater need for plasma and a decrease in donor rates in order to provide an immunity boost to COVID-affected patients. So, If an appropriate plasma donor cannot be found within a certain amount of time, the affected patient's condition may worsen and possibly result in death and it is also difficult to contact a donor among the patient's family and friends in a timely manner. It can also be difficult to make contact with authorised donor centres.Therefore, main purpose of Our application enables patients with severe liver illnesses, blood clotting issues, and covid to quickly and easily locate the correct donor within the allotted period.</h4>
